Claire,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,","Check the prices of the items on the menu in google before going. Ordered a spinach and mushroom sandwich and a cucumber iced green tea with mint. The sandwich costed ~₹250 and iced tea was ~₹270. Ridiculously overpriced. The sandwich had barely any spinach and 2 tiny mushroom slices inside and the sandwich itself was 4’’*4’’ cut into four squares with a spoon of some sauce on the side.Now, coming to the iced tea, look at the glass which I was served in. It wasn’t washed properly since ages and the black mold was food deposited time after time and getting rotten. To my luck I saw the disgusting thing after I with great difficulty drank half of it. It was stale and I was borderline gonna puke. Asked for a spoon of honey but was told I’d be charged for it. Was instead offered sugar -_-When complained to the server and the (manager?) he took the glass and told me he’d get it checked and gave me the money back in cash as I’d already paid for the food and the tea. Was also told they’d tank all the glasses.Please be aware of the utensils and items you get served with and just skip the disgust i underwent.Check the prices of the items on the menu in google before going.

AL B,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,","Cafe coffee day when you get there, itâ€™s table service so sit down anywhere. They arenâ€™t quick to take your order but thatâ€™s because in Bangalore India itâ€™s a slow paced environment for food and restaurants.The selection of beverages is amazing. You can have coffee, tea, mocktails, or just water. You also have a large selection of food. From savory to sweet. There are also pairings available. If youâ€™re veg or non-veg an option is there for you.The food... wow! Flavor. It is not what Americans expect from India. (Most) People  stereotype Indian food as curry, masala, rice and wheat. But they have a great twist on the foods westerns and others have come to love.My meal: triple cheesy churn has burger. Veg burger with a a relish and baby potatoes roasted. Each bite was an explosion of flavor. The smoked guda complimenting the spices from the vegetable patty. The cream cheese was all the star though. It was Slightly sweet but some heat to it as well.The relish; mild in heat with bell pepper and lettuce. Mixed with the baby potatoes seasoned with love, it gives a nice starchy contrast to the rich burger.The coffee. Light. Sweet. But strong. I enjoyed  monsoon mist pour over at the recommendation of my server. The aroma from the grounds was surrounding my senses, but as soon as the water hit, the perfume of sweet coffee permeated the air. The sweetness from the coffee compliments the flavors of the veg burger very well. All of this for about 870 Rs ($14 USD) and 120 Rs tip. Iâ€™ll be going back.Cafe coffee day when you get there, itâ€™s table service so sit down anywhere.

The ambience is gorgeous with all the colours popping out, but the food leaves me with mixed feelings, especially at the price charged. Essentially, until a few years back, all the CCD outlets used to serve nice food and beverages and this one was a whole other level with the entire offering being nothing less than that of a fine-dine. Now however, the situation is that what all the other CCDs serve is largely unacceptably disappointing, and what this one serves has also declined to the level of what the other outlets served back in the day. Not that itâ€™s exactly bad, but as the crown jewel of CCD Iâ€™d expect at least this branch to maintain its standards over time. But at least for how things actually are at the moment, a lot of their traffic has now moved to the Starbucks down the road (also Bangaloreâ€™s flagship one) given the price point, and the only thing still working in the Squareâ€™s favour is their larger full-meal menu.This is the flagship outlet of CCD, located bang at the most enviable location in town at the Vittal Mallya Road-Kasturba Road-Cubbon Park junction in the CCD head office.

But anyway, that wasn't the problem -We'll start with the washrooms. Dirty dirty dirty. Garbage overflowing outside of the bin and a broken seat cover. For a place that tries to market itself as worthy of an automatic 5% service charge, the washroom sure was a let down.But what was perhaps most disappointing was my beverage, followed by the complete LACK OF SERVICE from the staff. I took one sip and gagged. The ""hint of vanilla"" that was used to describe the beverage was actually a punch in the face of sugar. It was completely unpalatable. I left the full beverage and went to the cash register. Again, for the 5% service charge, not a single person came by to check on me or ask if I was enjoying the beverage. When I went to the register, I informed the staff member that I had left the entire beverage because it was far too sweet and not good at all. I was then met with the stares and gazes of about 6 other employees, at least one of whom looked like a supervisor/manager, who watched as I was then made to pay Rs. 283 for a beverage I never drank. And yes, that was with the added service charge, because for some reason, they felt like their disgusting beverage, absentee staff, and grimey washrooms deserved an extra 5%.Will not be returning and will be advising others of the same.Absolutely not worth it.

Which was really unexpected by the square. At the end when I checked the menu for ordering something else, I also checked the description of my cold coffee again and saw that the toppings were missing., so I called one of the attendants and asked them about the toppings but as I had already finished the drink he said that he would serve me the whole drink again but why should I have the drink again? Isn't it their incompetence that they didn't serve the drink properly at the first ? And the charges were applied full. Although it was an unexpected act by the square but yet the attendants were quite good. Well, I would not reccomend anyone to visit this cafe.It was my first experience with my grandmother in the square. It was the worst experience I had ever had.

Navie,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,","-staff said that the place is open only from 8am when I called. But it actually is open from 7am. The breakfast is served from a little later on. So I guess the he gave me misleading information for his own comfort.-he made me switch places because he wanted to clean the area i was sitting in. Don’t restaurants and cafes clean while closing up, isn’t that the practice worldwide? And why is one corner unclean and other part clean?-he asked me again to change the place as the plug point at one corner isn’t working. I’m already frustrated now without my morning coffee.-I gave him my to-go ceramic cup with the lid so I can leave with my coffee after a bit. I asked him to rinse with hot water. But he misunderstood as me wanting hot water. I clarified that I just wanted it washed and he still served my drink in a regular glass because his layering decoration won’t be visible in my opaque to-go cup as the transparent cup he served me in.-cafe coffee day radio is so annoying with the lady talking all the time. Just play ambient classical music or latest hits. Songs collections are quite awful tbh.-wifi connectivity is complicated. OTP is fine. But I have to get the daily pin from the barista and it got over in a minute after updating one of my adobe apps.-only good thing about my entire experience is that the guy helped me connect to wifi when I had trouble and made sure my wifi was working. That’s why 2 stars or I’d have gone for 1-starbucks should open one nearby so I could go there. Quite an awful experience overall. I tried CCD after a long time despite my dislike thinking there would be some improvement. But you guys lost an opportunity here. I am a guy who works out of coffee places regularly ordering atleast 2 coffees.-staff said that the place is open only from 8am when I called. But it actually is open from 7am.

That's it.Now, saying that the food was bad would be an understatement. I think the potato served as a side with the paneer  bunnychow  was rotten. It was cold and had the taste of something that is turned bad. The South Indian platter had cold and rock hard idlis. When we asked why the  food is cold and tastes bad , they said ""that's how it's supposed to be"".

There's plentiful natural light streaming through most of the day. Outdoors seating though limited to three tables caters to smokers and overlooks the busy Outer Ring Road. The wifi is mostly good, encouraging work-from-home types to work over rounds of cappuccinos. The sandwiches and rolls, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian are delicious, though pricey. There's a wide range of sundaes, shakes, smoothies and cold coffees. Their signature hot coffees are as reliable as ever.Vegetarian options: Sandwiches.Kid-friendliness: No. It's primarily for older people to hang out and work, have meetings or relax with a book.Parking: Parking bikes on the side of the road shouldn't be too difficult but parking cars is an issue on the busy Outer Ring Road.Wheelchair accessibility: Yes.Dietary restrictions: Gluten-free options mostly unavailable.

Though Cafe Coffee Day also has good snacking options.The only thing that bothered me while visiting this place was that if you place the order online from ccd using some food ordering apps like Zomato then you get around 40% discount on your order amount (definitely capped to some maximum limit say for ex Rs 200 INR).

He asked me to pay through Paytm which I don’t use.After all these inconveniences he told us he cannot give one Cocoa Fantasy for four and the order must be at least of ₹300 which I have not heard in any of the other CCD stores I have been to.We had a talk over this with the same staff and he wasn’t any interested to serve us or take the order.

Jacob Philips,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,","One of the worst experiences EVER!The table we sat at had the previous diners left overs on it and nobody was available to clean up. I had to do it myself. The staff were nowhere to be seen! It looked like they all took a break together.When I went to order my drink the staff were all aloof and least bothered to help out with my order. He handed me a menu card and asked me to choose from that one. Being a relatively new customer I didn't know there was an ACTUAL menu (which I found out later). I chose one item and he said that the drink that I wanted was out of stock and he suggested that I take the most expensive item on that menu! I clearly told him I wanted a simple cold drink and he proceeded to get me what can only be described as a COLD ESPRESSO! I mean even with sugar in it, it was basically inedible! We complained about this but he was unwilling to change the order and said that I'd have to pay extra to ""upgrade"" the present one! He did hear that I wanted something cold. I would assume he knows their entire menu by heart since he works there, but he chose to exploit me. I ended up paying Rs.210 for nothing!Normally I stay away from this chain mainly because they overcharge for simple things and this was my first visit after almost 3 years. It was a serious wake up call for me as to why I stayed away in the first place!Pathetic service! The only saving grace at this place was the decent ambience!I would NEVER recommend this establishment to anyone!Food: 1/5  |  Service: 1/5  |  Atmosphere: 3/5One of the worst experiences EVER!The table we sat at had the previous diners left overs on it and nobody was available to clean up.

JISHNU KUMARAN,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,","Pros:- Good place where one can have a coffee or cool beverages (non alcoholic) and can do their own work . Nobody will ask you even if you sit for more than 4-5 hours . It's mainly famous for this type of culture where 2 ppl can meet and talk calmly for hours. Food options are not much but one will get snacks related items with coffee, tea , espresso etc. The place of this CCD is in the prime location of indira nagar.Cons:- One thing which i noticed here was there are 2 sitting places one is inside and one is outside , the inside one was fine but the outside one i have seen 1 person smoking and i personally feel it's not good to allow smoking in the public place where other ppl are also sitting and talking. Parking space is not there so one might have to pay for bike parking in the indira nagar metro station. Items are too costly here, Tea costs 180 Rs.

Usually it'll be in the usual CCD white ceramic cups and there will be some decoration on the coffee.While, we know that CCD is overpriced but charging Rs145 for a cup of coffee and layer serving it in a paper cup is absolutely unjust. (Presentation also matters)! If you are giving in paper cup and with no decoration nothing then charge less! You can't charge 150 for just pouring coffee from the vending machine.(i can also do that).Also, when I ordered the coffee, i paid by card and the lady at the counter didnt give me any bill. She only gave the card transaction receipt.It was only when I asked for the bill(sometime later, after receiving my coffee and starting to consume it) that she generated the bill and gave me.When she generated the bill later, she realized that she charged extra (145 instead of 131) and gave me the balance amount back.It was an empty counter. I wonder how can the person at service forget to generate the bill only and charge extra from customer!

Jevika Shetty,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,","I visited the Cafe at Kormangla branch. This was an unpleasant experience for two reasons - firstly, the place can often get super crowded and noisy. This by default takes away the charm of a cafe and turns into more of a bustling restaurant. Therefore, we found it very difficult to work in there. Secondly, the staff seems to care more about making money than actually providing you a courteous service. We were a group of 6-8 people who met to discuss work, and found a spot outdoors. When the atmosphere got too noisy, we decided to move in. Except the staff denied us a spot inside on the account that each of us had to order something.After we did so, we finally moved in and continued our discussion, only to be approached by the staff once again. This time they politely ""kicked us out"" because they didn't want customers to take up space for ""too long"", else they may lose potential customers. This was my first ever experience wherein a cafe staff demands it's customers leave on such a note.Therefore, definitely not visiting this cafe again and would highly recommend other cafes in the area over this one, if you want a warmer experience. Two stars given to these guys just because of a good variety of beverages and desserts.I visited the Cafe at Kormangla branch.

Raj Ranjan Dhir,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,","You can't buy happiness, but you can buy Coffee.This Cafe Coffee Day is in top of my list of all Cafe Coffee Day Lounges because I have got some really lovely memories attached to this place. It is a nice cozy place perfect for dating or simply hanging out with friends or your loved ones. The best thing is its open till midnight. So it's quite relaxing and romantic at same time to spend time your loved ones and having a midnight dessert.The ambience is quite nice in this place. There are huge glass doors with nice sofa seats next to the glass door and then it leads to small section where their is souvenir stand with glasses and saucers. There is one hugger stand that has coffee beans and powders that been bought from CCD. The outlet has these special fancy fans fitted to the ceiling which also adds to the decor of this place.Though Coffee makes me happy, but I don't get the whole hype about the Coffee chains and the logic behind the pricing. I do enjoy a cuppa once a while but find the filter coffee more comforting and tasty. Also at a lesser than quarter the price.The place has multiple items in terms of food and drinks. This time we had ordered the Cranberry specials which was part of the Magical Brews. The Cranberry Latte was ok, tasted just like the regular Latte but the Cranberry Hot Chocolate was delicious with a strong flavour of Cranberry. The staff recommended the Cripsy Veg Wrap when asked about something fresh and it was fresh and nice. Now looking forward to trying the Red Velvet specials from the Magical Brew Series. Ordered some Almond Biscuits, they were actually the rusk that we get at bakeries that can be dipped in Coffee/ Tea and taken. The taste of the biscuits is quite good and it goes along quite well with the Coffee that we end up taking.This is a good place to come along with friends and family, have a conversation over Coffee One experience that surprised was that the person at the store was quite hesitant when I wanted to click pictures. He was telling it was against policy. It was little surprised why he did that because I have not heard of it anywhere else. I would leave it up to the CCD Management to handle.You can't buy happiness, but you can buy Coffee.This Cafe Coffee Day is in top of my list of all Cafe Coffee Day Lounges because …More",2020-06-27,Café Coffee Day HSR,Positive

Lithin George,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,","Gradually we see a slight decline in the overall quality and ambiance in the CCD outlets across Bangalore. In particular, the one on 100 feet road used to be a haven of a Cafe but now it's more like a showpiece for their products like cookies and cakes. The menu has been cut down and the items that we order might not be available. But still, the brownie and the vanilla coffee were decent. Our main gripe with the cafe though stems from the fact that it was overrun by mosquitos and there was no countermeasures taken for that.Hence the tranquility usually associated with CCD could not be extended here.Gradually we see a slight decline in the overall quality and ambiance in the CCD outlets across Bangalore.

The only reason we agreed to come to coffee day is bcz of ambiance and the fact that you can conduct the meeting for long hours. He says you need to order more in order to stay longer, if that was the case we would have order one by one instead of ordering everything at once.This wasn't all the same guy started doing the same thing to bunch of students who have actually ordered stuff and still consuming it.

Chai S,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,","By far, the worst coffee day experience. It's location is of convenience, which is the only pro.The entire outlet is poorly maintained. Sticky tables, dirty floors, under trained staff and unclean cups. Most of the items on the menu are ""not in stock"", as quoted by the staff.Quite ironic to the name of the brand 'Coffee Day', their coffee was the worst. They know how to mess a simple cappuccino and cold coffee (which seemed like a cup of froth and crushed ice respectively). The staff said there's no difference between a cappuccino and a latte.One of the staff spilt hot milk a customer while serving and the entire staff broke into a hysteria, and neither of them were apologetic to the customer.

Aswath,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,","Well, they should improve upon the coffee and pay more attention to customer needs. I ordered a hazelnut cappuccino and specifically asked for sugarless. And the manager agreed. Two issues after it was brought to me. It was lukewarm, like 40-50 degrees, which is too cold and it had a load of sugar in it. Apparently the hazelnut syrup has sugar. How am I supposed to know that. The manager was very apologetic, but the deeds already done.

Caleb Friesen,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,","The cashier who took my order insisted on calling an Americano as black coffee, and she did not know what was a Doppio. Ethiopian single-origin coffee on the menu is not available, or the cashier doesn't know what it is, not sure which. Despite there being only 2-3 customers, my order of 2 drinks took 15 minutes. Cashier, who also served our drinks, was wearing mask around her neck, not covering her mouth or nose as she carried our drinks (and I'm assuming also prepared our drinks). However, this is a pet-friendly place, so I have given 2 stars instead of 1 star.The cashier who took my order insisted on calling an Americano as black coffee, and she did not know what was a Doppio.
