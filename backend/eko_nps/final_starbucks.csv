Nitin Mukesh,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,","As everyone knows and the brand name suggests about Starbucks, it has everything which an international brand should have. But the most important thing about this Starbucks is that there is no dedicated parking area or even outside parking to it. Which is a nightmare these days if valet parking or any sort of convenience is not available. I stayed there for two and hours and somehow I found a paid parking in that same lane going little further after asking two three pedestrians. And after I came back to take back my car I paid 250 bucks for two and a half hours which I feel was way costlier than a coffee itself at some good place. Rest I don't want to describe much about Starbucks because the coffee ordered was good and even the restroom was clean. So , my verdict to this particular Starbucks is that if there is no car driving then can be visited for sure.As everyone knows and the brand name suggests about Starbucks, it has everything which an international brand should have.

Archita Bhalotia,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,","Starbucks in general is over priced and ordinarily flavored. Coffee is good but nothing out of the world. The ambience is welcoming of social, personal and professional engagements. Going there to work on a hot afternoon might be a good idea but if you have a different place in mind, you can skip this one.Their food is supremely overpriced for the quantity, quality and flavor that they give. The croissant was flaky but seemed stale.Most of their drinks are super high on sugar making them annoyingly sweet. So, if you want something less sweet, a cold Brew or tea could be a better choice.If it's your birthday month, sign up for their membership program and perhaps get a free drink!Overall, local Cafes will certainly give you a better charm and most importantly, better coffee.Starbucks in general is over priced and ordinarily flavored.

The cafe is conveniently just a minute's walk from the Forum Mall, Koramangala (You need to exit the mall where you will see Bosh in front of the mall, there are two entrances to the Forum mall). I've given a 3/5 for a couple of reasons. One, the toilet facility is really small for a two storey cafe, you may have to wait in line to use it. Second thing to note is, the menu is missing a few drinks when you compare it to overseas Starbucks outlets. (For example, Chai Latte is off the menu throughout India apparently). Indians love Chai ! Free WiFi is available for customers for a limited time/data usage. That's a plus. Is the coffee overpriced ? The price is almost at par with overseas outlets, so definitely on the expensive side when you compare it with competitors in Bangalore but that's Starbucks for you.This is the first Starbucks to open in Bangalore.

They took so long to check the camera (to see if we have taken any money) Just because we’re teenagers, doesn’t mean we get treated this way! We were so disappointed so I called up my guardian (adult) and when I was about to give the phone to the cashier, that moment she handed the money. Even while handing the money she said the exact words “Take ma, take and go off, we did not even check the camera, but take take” in an absolute rude manner.

My go to order is a French press with this blend. Their Christmas blend (seasonal) is also quite nice. I like their nachos and freshly prepared sandwiches.I am also in love with their playlist. Some times it is old school jazz or blues that plays at just the right volume in the background and it sets a very cozy mood!Recommended dishes

Prathik R,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,","There's a different air about a Starbucks. Most middle class folks (including myself) don't get it. Basically it's just another cafe, but mainly for those that want that extra special touch, i.e going the extra mile. Allow me to elaborate:I spent an entire day working here, from breakfast to dinner. Fast free wifi, ample charging spots, chill atmosphere, soothing ambient music.The freshly prepared sandwiches are fantastic, and the croissants just melts in your mouth. Coffee is same as most cafes, but the staff is quite knowledgeable about a customers intricate requirements.The staff welcomes everyone and bids bye as well, which i found endearing. On the day i went, they even gave the entire cafe a free cake slice sample coz they're trying out a new flavour apparently. The guy taking my order went over and beyond to tailor make my coffee just the way i wanted it, even giving me a few suggestions to suit my taste buds. (I basically suggested requirements which i thought matched a macchiato but apparently a costada was more suiting for me, it wasn't on the menu, but they still made it).Minor things that can be improved: Wooden seating is fine but man does it pain after a while of sitting. Ac is super strong, sends you to the ice age.Vegetarian options: Separate sectionParking: Only few parking for cars but ample for two wheelerWheelchair accessibility: There's outdoor seating which is accessibility friendlyFood: 5/5  |  Service: 5/5  |  Atmosphere: 5/5There's a different air about a Starbucks.

Prashant Jain,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,","I am a coffee lover and I do go to lot of coffee shops including Tata Starbucks. Also, I am a gold member of Tata Starbucks. I visited this store today. I was hungry so I ordered the food also along with coffee. They have given me an option to order one more food item to get 50% discount. At first, I didn’t want to buy one more food item. Then I thought to avail the offer thinking it is Tata Starbucks and the food quality is good here. So I decided to buy one more food item thinking I am going to try something new from the menu. When I received my order I realized that I was cheated in the name of 50% discount. The food was so bad, I couldn’t even finish it. The food was stale. It wasn’t fresh at all. It looked like it was prepared couple of days ago. It was smelly and tasted like hell. I paid good amount of money for the order (for fresh food) but what I got was rubbish.  I didn’t expect that. I finished my coffee and ran away from the store. Later, I was thinking what else I could do with that amount of money. I was thinking, was it really Tata Starbucks? The two big brand names in the world are selling rubbish in India. This would be an end of my membership with Tata Starbucks.
