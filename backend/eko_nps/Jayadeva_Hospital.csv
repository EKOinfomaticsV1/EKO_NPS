Spurti Devadhar,1.0,"Pathetic.We admitted my 88-year Grandpa for a cardiac emergency. They kept him on a temporary pacemaker for 1 week and made him undergo 3 dialysis sessions. He was assigned to the basement ICU. After 7 days, we were not happy with the treatment and took him home after some unimaginably terrible bed sores. They also scared us that he was in no condition to be taken home and that he would collapse immediately. The doctor on duty was very harsh while removing the temporary Pacemaker. Overall, we were very disheartened by the entire treatment procedure, the doctors and the attitude of the sisters on call.

He was asked to get admitted considering his reports from The other hospital. We admitted him in ICCU3.There were blood samples taken, I was shocked with the duty Dr. And the staff’s behaviour who were not revealing the results of the blood test.My husband was put on a stretcher without any machine attached to him .. later in the morning he was shifted in the pavement as some other patient was brought and got admitted ..The whole day there was no proper response. He was provided with a torn bed sheet no pillow.. with an arrogant group of staff.Since he was just lying on stretcher as an attendant I checked if he can be shifted to any room. Which was not done.. the Dr. Looked offensive when asked these questions.He was changing statements each time . When I asked about the blood reports he didn’t mention anything .. later when my FIL came he mentioned that there were fluctuations in his blood report.Even if so was the case why didn’t the Dr. Inform me .. why was my husband kept on a stretcher without any observation done ..The director and facilities have to keep a look what’s happening in the departments.

I am sharing my experiences, which might come handy to those looking for some upto date review about the hospitalAbout : Anyone staying at bangalore can easily guide you to Jayadeva. Jayadeva is famous for both cardio and diabetic care. You can easily end up at diabetic center for cardio needs and vice versa. Do go by the security staff. Look for the boards CARDIO, DIABETES.Cardio services: If you are an OP, ask at the helpdesk for registration. Its a token based system. First come first serve 150 patients per day. Get your token sit back relax. A group of 10 people are called for registration or revisit: Helper at the token counter is very courteous who will guide you to OPD for registration . Rs 100 for one time registration. Very speed and efficient front end staffRoom 1: Hosts about 8 doctors who take notes and recommend tests on a need by basis. Doctors are very courteous as well. Again, don't forget to keep your token safe. If you are asked for blood, ECG or echo tests, you will be addressed in that order only. Better get a token for echo before other tests. Most of the doctors are pretty young, which might matter for a few.ECG wait time 10 minutesBlood test wait time 5 minutesECHO wait time 40 to 60 minutesTMT wait time 90 minsTake out the perception out of your mind that its like a govt hospital.

ICU supposed to calm patients so that their own fears are relaxed but in my dad case the opposite happened. this happened in ICCU 2 . SO kind request is avoid it . the doctor who dealed with my dad spoke like a business man rather than like a doctor such a cheap attitude. avoid this hospital even though doctors r okay support staff r f all. worst is they r selling their products like ambulance available for taking the dead home. white bed sheets r available for wrapping the dead. cleaning staff r commission agents. just because hospital is cheap does not mean u hv to screw up patients life. as it was rightly said IF U PAY PEANUTS ONLY MONKEYS COME. in my dad case this happened and i lost my lovable dad. avoid if u want to save lives.worst support staff i have seen.
